Market Overview:
     We work in the Healthcare EDI Markets, because of our expertise in electronic formats, such as X12 / EDI.  The Market is changing but there are still 2 or 3 entity types
     in this market: (1) A healthcare Payer, (2) a "Provider" (Hospital, Doctor, Clinic, etc.) and (3) Patient.

     There are also changes in the host environment.  In the past, no one would ever dare move patient data past the Firewall.  Today, whole business models are available, from
     services related to Azure, AWS or Google.  We will note that, in our opinion, there is a serious lack of respect for EDI....and this is where techies ultimately fail: underestimating
     the importance of Strategic EDI planning.  We take it seriously AND come to this project with some resourceful ideas, born from experience and creativity.

Project Overview:
     We want to build or facilitate a scalable Cloud solution, that can navigate the Technical EDI mysteries....by allowing for both Analytics and Enrollment-Jumping Models (EJM's).
     "Analytics"?  This is a broad subject; but, we'd prefer to focus on Diagnosis and Procedure Codes, with an eye for tracking Pandemics and any other illnesses...where they are and
    what is proceedures are being used (and their costs), to mitigate these health issues.  What is an EJM's?  Basically, we would like to allow more communication between OON (Out Of Network)
    Providers and the whole Nation of potential Patients.  This could cause heated competition in the Healthcare Payer Market and allow Patients to have some method to escape being treated like
    a nameless group.  This COULD be used to help Medicaid Plans, by offering a reliable and likely MUCH cheaper solution.  In the purest sense, the Purpose of Medicaid and Other Payers is NOT
    technology, it's helping Patients.  We'd simply like to make that more practical.

 Functional Overview:   
     OK, how do we DO this?  At this point, we will need to switch from text-based communication, to a media that can facilitate Flow Diagrams, Business-Process Overviews, etc.  You have the
     basic model: Cloud Based.  Modular Python scripting (for universal Operating System Facilitation), and then some choices on related data-processing and data-storing and data-analyzing
     methodologies.  This will change from Project to project.  The purpose of THIS project, will be to build an example model....and offer it as either a springboard or as an example.
     More to come.
